### FAQ 🙋‍

**Why Can't I add my own/custom buttons?**
Because it's a limitation in VSCode, you can't modify [package.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/extension-manifest) of extension where the buttons are configured.

**Can you add 'xyz' button for me?**  
Sure, you can request a button by creating a github issue here https://github.com/JerryGoyal/Shortcut-Menu-Bar-VSCode-Extension/issues
Please note that It would take some time as I am usually occupied with many things.
You can also make changes to [repo](https://github.com/JerryGoyal/Shortcut-Menu-Bar-VSCode-Extension/) and send me a PR to speed-up the process.

**Can I contribute to repo to add my button?**  
Yes, Please. Just go through the [repo](https://github.com/JerryGoyal/Shortcut-Menu-Bar-VSCode-Extension/), it's fairly simple to understand code and add a button. Send me a PR!  
Few resources: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api

**How can I disable/Enable a button?**  
By going to extension settings. see above screenshot.
